    Note: The training data includes three classes, not just two.
    1. Road in front of the vehicle.
    2. Not a road
    3. Road that is not in front of the vehicle.

    Modify helper.gen_batch_function() to create a label for all three classes.
    The initial implementation just separates the image into red and not-red.
    Modify to look for black as well (or pink, but black is easier to represent as rgb).

    Existing implementaion labels red pixels as 'false', everything else is 'true'.
    Modify to use an integer class, e.g., red==0, black==1, pink/other=2
